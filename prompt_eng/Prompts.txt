"I want you to act as a front-end web developer.
You will code a new website for the project using the following tools:
Bootstrap framework using CDN for HTML, CSS.
The website should be mobile-friendly and responsive.
Additionally, in terms of layout and style, the site structure should also include the latest version of Twitter Bootstrap CSS classes.
It is important to provide HTML, CSS codes as separate outputs.
Also, you should add a navigation menu containing internal links to the headings in the page content.
Do not comment on the code you write.
I want a website that briefly showcases examples of food recipes. The website should include only 4 food recipes and every food recipes should be listed on the homepage.
The tags I want to include on my website are (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer).
I want a logo in the header section of the page, and similarly, I want one logo in the footer section.
I want the content of the page to be in a gallery view, with 300x400 sized images, with 2 images per grid, and I don't want the content of the images to be cropped.
It would be nice if the images had a hover transition effect.
Can you help me create this website?
Add a red background to the titles of the food recipes and change the text style color to white.
Also, resize the logo to 100x100 and move it to top left corner.
Additionally, can you align the navigation section to the left?"
